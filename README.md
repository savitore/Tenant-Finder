Tenant Finder App

My project is Tenant Finder. I have choosen App development as I have a very keen interest in developing apps. I want to put my ideas into building new and unique apps.

This is an application that serves as a platform for finding a tenant. 
If anyone is looking for a property, this app will show all the available properties and the necessary details. 
This app will allow users to rent their property and find any other listed property.

The application will allow the user to login to the app by two methods: 
Using username and password &  
Using their Google account
In Login Page, there is also an option of "Forgot Password".
Unregistered users can also register themselves by clicking on "Sign Up".


The application will allow the user to view the details of all the listed properties using recycler view. 
There will be a separate section in the app where users can add their property for rent. 
There is also a search bar through which users can search the properties.
There is also an option of Signing out of the app.
I have completed Frontend of User Profile and Liked Properties.
For add properties option, user is also able to upload the property image.

TechStack:
1)Android Studio
2)Firebase Authentication
3)Firebase Realtime Database
4)Firebase Firestore
5)Firebase Storage
6)Frontend Components: Tab Layout using View Paper/Bottom Nav View, Recycler View for list.

I am very thankful to my mentors, Garvit Dua Sir and Bhavya Agrawal Sir for their constant support during Winter Of Code timeline.
